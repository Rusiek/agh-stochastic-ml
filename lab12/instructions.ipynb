We'll first examine the original Cuckoo Search paper and then critically analyze it using the paper \"An analysis of why cuckoo search does not bring any novel ideas to optimization.\" This exercise builds on our previous discussions of evolutionary algorithms like Differential Evolution and the pitfalls of poor research in fields like Neuroevolution, focusing here on the problem of redundant concepts in optimization."
